          <p>
            We learned that GitHub is a version control system that tracks the
            changes made to a project. Some of the specific skills we learned were
            how to create and use a repository, how to start a branch, how to make
            changes to a file and then commit then and then push them to the repo.
            We also learned about merging branches to the master. Another thing we
            leared was how to assign issues.
